# Marvel Showcase

iOS Application and frameworks that works with Marvel API written in Swift

This repository is based on an assignment for **Cafebazaar** interview.
Assignment asks the following:

- Using **storyboards** is not allowed but **NIB** files are ok.

So initial project has no storyboards (except for launchscreen) . Also this projcet contains no unnecessary codes, even  in **AppDelegate** file.


We Don't want to couple this project with third party libraries. So we implement our own *Webservice Handler framework*. This framework could be a wrapper around any third party framework we may add later.

More details comming soon...
